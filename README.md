# Table of Contents Bookmarklet

Document outlines are helpful when you want to skim a document—whether you do that with your eyeballs, eardrums, fingertips, or brainwave injections.

In 2016 Marijke Luttekes wrote a bookmarklet that prints the document outline of the current document. Super helpful for getting that quick overview. Helper for people that want to know what’s on the page. Helpful for developers that want to check their document’s outline. Helpful for everyone!
